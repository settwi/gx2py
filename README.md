# gx2py Repository

Welcome to the gx2py repository! This platform is designed to gather Python code examples that demonstrate the implementation of various  [GX Simulator](https://github.com/Gelu-Nita/GX_SIMULATOR) and [GSFIT](https://github.com/Gelu-Nita/GSFIT) functionalities, originally implemented in IDL. The goal is to provide a collaborative space for contributors to share their expertise and collectively achieve the objectives of the SUNCAST collaboration.

## How to Contribute

We encourage individuals passionate about advancing the goals of the SUNCAST collaboration to contribute to this repository. You can do so in two ways:

### 1. Subfolders in this Repository

Feel free to submit your Python code examples directly as subfolders within this repository. This straightforward method allows for easy organization and access to all code contributions in one central location.

### 2. Linked Submodules on Your GitHub Account

For a more dynamic and self-updating approach, consider submitting your code as a linked submodule residing on your GitHub account. This enables contributors to update their code without the need for frequent pull requests.

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain a cohesive and collaborative environment, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

- Clearly document your code, providing explanations and comments for better understanding.
- Use descriptive filenames and folder structures to enhance readability.
- Ensure your code adheres to Python best practices and follows PEP 8 conventions.

## Including a Jupyter Notebook and Test Data

We highly encourage contributors to include a top-level Jupyter notebook demonstrating the proposed functionality. Additionally, providing a reasonable-sized test dataset within the repository helps users better understand and test the code examples.

## Disclaimer

Please note that content submitted to this repository, demonstrating potential implementations, will only be reviewed by the administration for relevance to the SUNCAST collaboration's scope. If contributors may choose to include links to independently managed repositories, the administrators of this repository cannot warrant the intended functionality of these examples. Moreover, the proposed approaches might not be eventually adopted for inclusion in the official versions of the fully vetted functional SUNCAST repositories.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and explore the existing examples. You can then either submit your code directly or set up a linked submodule on your GitHub account.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to building a robust collection of Python implementations for GX Simulator and GSFIT functionalities. Together, let's propel the SUNCAST collaboration forward!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with the contribution process.

Happy coding!
